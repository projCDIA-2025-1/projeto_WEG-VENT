Step 3: 6-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-1-oxa-6-azaspiro[2.5]octane-2-carbonitril
To a solution of 1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl) carbonyl] piperidin-4-one [Example 1, Step 2] (2 g, 7.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dichloromethane (20 mL) was added sodium hydroxide (30.5% in H2O) (5.4 mL, 7.00 equiv), TBAC (108 mg, 0.38 mmol, 0.05 equiv) and 2-chloroacetonitrile (1.18 g, 15.6 mmol, 2.00 equiv) at 0° C. The reaction solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting solution was diluted with water (100 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with dichloromethane (3×100 mL). The organic layers were washed with brine (3×50 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to afford 1.1 g (48%) of 6-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-1-oxa-6-azaspiro[2.5]octane-2-carbonitril as a brown solid.
