Synthesis of compound 50-e
A mixture of compound 50-f and water (40mL) was heated to reflux for 2hrs, cooled to room temperature, white solid was precipitated and filtered out. Solid was washed with water (20mLÃ—3), dried under vacuum to give compound 50-e (1.6g, yield 64%). The product was used directly for the next step without further purification.
