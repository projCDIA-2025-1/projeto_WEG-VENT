Preparation of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
DMF (2 mL) and DIPEA (0.074 mL, 0.42 mmol) were added sequentially to a flask charged with N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine (75 mg, 0.17 mmol). 1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (31.9 mg, 0.17 mmol) in DMF (0.1 mL) was then added, and stirring was continued for 2 hours. The reaction was stopped, diluted with saturated aqueous sodium chloride and the compound was extracted in EtOAC (Ã—3). The combined extracts were washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a film. This material was purified by flash silica chromatography, eluting with 2 to 10% (methanol containing 1% ammonium hydroxide) in DCM to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (43 mg, 51%).
