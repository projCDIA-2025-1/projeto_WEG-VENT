[Step 3] Synthesis of N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)tetrahydro-2H-thiopyran-4-carboxamide 1,1-dioxide
Methyl 4-((N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1,1-dioxidotetrahydro-2H-thiopyran-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-fluorobenzoate (1.240 g, 2.628 mmol), synthesized in step 2, and hydrazine monohydrate (2.554 mL, 52.554 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (20 mL)/water (5 mL) at room temperature, and the solution was stirred at 80Â°C for 5 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The title compound was used without further purification (1.180 g, 95.2%) as yellow solid.
