Example 8: Synthesis of (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate
Toluene solution (22.84 g) containing (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine (3.50 g:27.7 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 95% sulfuric acid (2.87 g: 27.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring on ice. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60째 C., to obtain (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate (4.85 g: 21.6 mmol, yield=78%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 108째 C., 175째 C., 286째 C.
