Intermediate 41: 8-Bromo-2-(tert-butyl)-7-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (3 mL) were added 3-bromo-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (100 mg, 0.54 mmol), 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one (0.16 mL, 1.18 mmol), and potassium phosphate (340 mg, 1.60 mmol). The vial was capped and heated to 160° C. in the microwave for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with H2O and extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-30% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a light yellow oil (105 mg, 74% yield).
