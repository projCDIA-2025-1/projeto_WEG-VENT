16.8: [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid
2.3 ml (2.3 mmol) of a 1N aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide is added to a solution of 475 mg (1.5 mmol) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate in 15 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 3 mL of water. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, and then adjusted to pH6 by adding 4 ml of 1N aqueous solution of acetic acid. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 400 mg (88%) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a white solid.
