Preparation of 5-bromo-1-methyl-3-(1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-pyrrolo-[2,3-b]pyridine
To a solution of 5-bromo-3-iodo-1-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (180 mg, 0.534 mmol) and 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-boronic acid (155 mg, 0.694 mmol) in dioxane (5.4 mL, degassed) was added tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (75 mg, 0.064 mmol), K2CO3 (369 mg, 2.67 mmol) and water (1.8 mL, degassed). The reaction mixture was heated at 40Â° C. for 15 h, cooled and partitioned between ethyl acetate and brine. The organic layer was separated, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give crude which was purified by chromatographic column to afford the desired product (106 mg, 65%).
