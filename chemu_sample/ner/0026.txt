Example 15A
1-(2-Methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-(2-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid
75 ml of trifluoroacetic acid were added to a solution of 5.0 g (11.2 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 10A in 225 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was stirred in diethyl ether and filtered off with suction, and the solid was dried under high vacuum. 4.1 g (92% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
