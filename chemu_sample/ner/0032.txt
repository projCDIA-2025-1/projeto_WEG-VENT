Step 2
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
3-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)phenol 3b (113 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of methanol, then (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl) acrylate 1e (113 mg, 0.5 mmol) and acetic acid (60 mg, 1 mmol) were added. The resulting mixture was heated to 55Â°C and stirred for 12 hours. After the reaction was stopped, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2, 3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 3c (15 mg, yield 7%) as a yellow solid.
