Step 2: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a solution of 2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (2.9 g, 4.83 mmol) in THF (20 ml) was added a 1 M solution of TBAF in THF (7.25 ml, 7.25 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour. It was quenched with water and diluted in EtOAc. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (1.74 g, 74% yield).
