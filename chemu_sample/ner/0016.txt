(a). 2-(7-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethan-1-ol
To a solution of 2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)acetic acid (4 g, 22.4 mmol) in methanol (40 mL) was added sulfuric acid (219 mg, 2.24 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated to 70Â° C. and stirred at that temperature for 2 h. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was added ethyl acetate (50 mL). The solution was washed with brine, then the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to provide methyl 2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)acetate (4.0 g, yield: 93%) as a yellow oil.
