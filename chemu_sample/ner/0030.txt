Step 2 Synthesis of compound 66h
To a solution of the compound 66g (4.21 g, 7.78 mmol) in DMF (42 mL), triphenylphosphine (2.45 g, 9.33 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Then, 8.4% aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (20.0 mL, 20.0 mmol) was added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. Then, water and ethyl acetate were added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 66h (1.76 g, 51%).
