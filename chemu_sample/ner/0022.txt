Step 2
To Compound 154 (30 mg, 0.057 mmol) and morpholine (0.015 mL, 0.171 mmol) in dichloromethane (0.9 mL), methanol (0.9 mL) and acetic acid (0.09 mL) solution was added picoline - borane complex (9.2 mg, 0.086 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (20 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated brine (20 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by amino silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 155 (23.2 mg, 68% yield) as brown foam.
