Comparative Example 4: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.diacetate
Toluene solution (55.77 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (5.56 g: 44.1 mmol) was charged into a 100 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and acetic acid (5.33 g: 88.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.diacetate (4.41 g: 39.0 mmol, yield=89%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 120° C., 152° C.
