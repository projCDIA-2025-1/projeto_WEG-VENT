Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.174 g, 2.51 mmol) was added to 1-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-N-((1S,3R)-1-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-yl)methanimine (1.53 g, 2.51 mmol) and potassium acetate (0.62 g, 6.27 mmol) in MeOH (12 mL). The resulting solution was stirred at 20Â° C. for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and diluted with DCM (75 mL) and washed sequentially with NaOH (2M, 75 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (50 mL). The organic layer was dried with MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product which was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.672 g, 63%) as a colourless gum.
