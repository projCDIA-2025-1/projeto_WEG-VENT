Compound 168B (710 mg, 1.51 mmol) was added to a solution of tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) at 25 °C and then a sodium hydroxide solution (2 mol/L, 3.78 ml) was added and the solution was stirred at 25 °C for 3 hours. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 2. The aqueous phase was filtered and the filter cake was washed with water (20 ml * 2), dried and concentrated to give compound 168C (white solid, 650 mg, the yield was 94.43%).
