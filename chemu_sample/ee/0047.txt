Example 17. (R)-N-(1-((4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 66.2 mg of 4-fluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0590 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=0:100→1:80→1:50). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 93.5 mg of (R)-N-(1-((4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 77.8%.
