1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-{N-[1-(R)-2-(R)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-1-hydroxy-prop-2-yl]carbamoyl}benzyl)carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 50 mg, 0.078 mmol) and tert-butyl (2R,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxybutanoate (15 mg, 0.086 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (2ml) and DMF (1ml) and N-methylmorpholine (17.2p1, 0.156 mmol) and TBTU (45 mg, 0.14 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was put directly on an Isolute column (2g, silica). The product was eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0, 95:5, 90:10 then 80:20 to give the title compound (33 mg, 53%). M/z 797.3.
