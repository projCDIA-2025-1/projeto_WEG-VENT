Step 2: 1-(2,4,5-Trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-yn-1-ol
To a solution of 2,4,5-trichloronicotinaldehyde (2.11 g, 10.03 mmol) in THF (30 ml) was added prop-1-yn-1-ylmagnesium bromide (0.5 M in THF, 26.1 ml, 13.03 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour. To the mixture was added aqueous saturated NH4Cl solution followed by extraction with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude was purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (1.95 g, 78% yield).
