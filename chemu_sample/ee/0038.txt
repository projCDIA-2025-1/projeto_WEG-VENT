Step 4 Synthesis of Compound 132
To 2,2-difluoroethane-1-ol (26.5 mg, 0.322 mmol) in dimethylformamide (0.35 mL) solution were added sequentially sodium hydride solution (12.9 mg, 0.322 mmol) and Compound 131 (35 mg, 0.064 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 80Â°C for 1 hour. 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by diol silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 132 (64 mg, 66% yield) as a yellow oily material.
