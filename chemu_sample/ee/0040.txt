c) A mixture of 4-t-butylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride (0.070 g, 0.30 mmol), 3-(difluoromethyl)-1-(quinolin-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (0.045 g, 0.17 mmol), and DMAP (0.020 g, 0.17 mmol) in pyridine (2 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. for 5 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, 5% methanol in ethyl acetate), followed by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.040 g, 0.085 mmol, 53%).
