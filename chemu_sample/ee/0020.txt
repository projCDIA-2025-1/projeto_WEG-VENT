[Step 2] Synthesis of N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-phenylacetamide
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-phenylacetamido)methyl)benzoate (0.158 g, 0.524 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and nitrogen oxide (0.495 mL, 10.487 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 5 hours and cooled down to room temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.150 g, 94.9%) as colorless oil.
