5-bromo-3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxypyridine
(5-Bromo-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol (1.876 g, 8.60 mmol), tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (1.556 g, 10.32 mmol), and imidazole (0.879 g, 12.91 mmol) were stirred in CH2Cl2 (35 mL) overnight at room temperature. After this time, 5 mL of CH3OH was added to quench the reaction, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and washed twice with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution and once with brine. The organic solution was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford the title compound 5-bromo-3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxypyridine (2.71 g, 95% yield).
