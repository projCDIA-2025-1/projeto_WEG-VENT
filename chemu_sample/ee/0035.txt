(Example 7) Synthesis of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride
Hydrochloric acid (1.0 N, 0.086 mL, 0.086 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.0220 g, 0.0785 mmol) in water (0.156 mL) at 0Â°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. The reaction liquid was concentrated under reduced pressure and dried at room temperature to obtain 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.0220 g, 0.0623 mmol, 79%) (hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 7) as a white solid.
