Example 391A
6-(Hydroxymethyl)-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-3-(3,4,4-trifluorobut-3-en-1-yl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
At −40° C., 737 μl (0.737 mmol) of a 1 M solution of lithium aluminium hydride in THF were added dropwise to a solution of 424 mg (0.737 mmol) of the compound from Example 363A in 17 ml of dry THF. On completion of addition, stirring was continued at RT for 1 h. Then 1 ml of 10% hydrochloric acid was added cautiously. 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution were added to the mixture, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 14). 199 mg (70% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
