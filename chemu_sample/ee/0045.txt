Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Acetic acid (541 mg, 9.01 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (714 mg, 1.80 mmol) in CHCl3 (8 mL). The reaction was cooled to 0° C., and a solution of isopentyl nitrite (422 mg, 3.60 mmol) in CHCl3 (1 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 2 hours and then quenched by the slow addition of a solution of NaHCO3 (1.5 g, 18 mmol) in water (20 mL). The phases were separated, and the organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 5 to 35% EtOAc in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (438 mg, 60%) as a light brown solid.
