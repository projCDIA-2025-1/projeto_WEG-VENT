(E)-methyl3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluoroph enyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-bromo-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 76e (200 mg, 0.373 mmol), 1-ethyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole 17a (166 mg, 0.746 mmol) and potassium carbonate (154 mg, 1.119 mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL of a mixture of 1,4-dioxane and water (V/V=5:1), then [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium (II) (27mg, 0.037mmol) was added. The mixture was warmed up to 85Â°C and was stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluoroph enyl)acrylate 76f (110 mg, yield 53%) as a yellow oil.
