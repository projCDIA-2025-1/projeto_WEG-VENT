Step 2: (R)-tert-Butyl (2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)carbamate
A stirred solution of (R)-8-(benzyloxy)-5-(2-(((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (2.65 g, 4.33 mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was added with a solution of di-tert-butyldicarbonate (1.13 g, 5.18 mmol) in DCM (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 30:1 DCM/7M NH3/MeOH) to afford the title compound (2.83 g, 92%).
